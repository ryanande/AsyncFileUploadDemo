AsyncFileUploadDemo
===================

Using XMLHttpRequest2 object along with then FormData object to upload files to a server via Web API asynchronously.

Used KnockoutJs on the UI side.

The [mongo branch](https://github.com/ryanande/AsyncFileUploadDemo/tree/mongo) details how we can take this example to up a notch and get files into a MongoDB  parkour!
